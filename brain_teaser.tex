\begin{exe}[Chess tournament]
A chess tournament has $2^n$ players with skills $1>2>\cdots>2^n$. It is organized as a
knockout tournament, so that after each round only the winner proceeds to the next
round. Except for the final, opponents in each round are drawn at random. Let's also
assume that when two players meet in a game, the player with better skills always wins.
What's the probability that players 1 and 2 will meet in the final?

\begin{exe}[100th digit]
What is the 100-th digit of $(1+\sqrt{2})^{3000}$? Equivalently, what is the unit digit of $(1+\sqrt{2})^{3000}*10^{100}$?\\
Hint: $(1+\sqrt{2})^2 + (1-\sqrt{2})^2=6$
\end{exe}

\begin{sol}
With the hint, we claim that $(1+\sqrt{2})^{3000} + (1-\sqrt{2})^{3000}$ is an integer. (Proofs needed?)\\
Also we have $|1-\sqrt{2}|<\frac{1}{2}$, hence $(1-\sqrt{2})^{3000}< \frac{1}{2^{3000}}<<10^{-100}$. So the 100th digit for $(1-\sqrt{2})^{3000}$ is 0, hence the 100th digit of $(1+\sqrt{2})^{3000}$ is 9.

\begin{exe}
How many numbers $x$ are there less that $10^6$ that the cubic of $x$ ends with 11, i.e. $x^3\ mod\  100=11$?
